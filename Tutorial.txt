1.Difference between React(Library) and Angular(Framework):

2.Advantages of React (updates DOM -Document Object Model - treats xml and html as a tree)

3.What is Components:
    (Piece of UI which can be reused/Something like functions which can be used wherever needed.)

4.What is Babel : 
    Transform jsx to js (JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ (ES6+) 
    code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines.)

    JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension and occasionally referred as JavaScript XML) is a React extension to
    the JavaScript language syntax which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax 
    familiar to many developers. It is similar in appearance to HTML

5.Virtual DOM in React:
    https://medium.com/devinder/react-virtual-dom-vs-real-dom-23749ff7adc9

6.<React.Fragment> : put under root instead of a div

7.Stateless functional component ( const <name>=()=>{return})

8.Destructioning arguments

9.Lifecycle Hooks
    Mounting : instance of a component is created and inserted into DOM (constructor,render,componentDidMount)
    Update : state or props change (render,componentDidUpdate)
    Unmount : component is removed from a DOM eg.deleteing a counter ( componentWillUnmount)
